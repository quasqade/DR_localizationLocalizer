# DR_localizationLocalizer
A quick and dirty way to translate global variables for Steam version of Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc.

To use it, obtain dr_localization.bin or point it directly to dr1_data.wad

Either run it without parameters in same folder as dr_localization.bin, or pass required file as first parameter.
When prompted, use some text editor that respects encoding (i.e. Notepad++) to edit the text file (do not replace newlines manually).
Do not access original or edited files in any way until software has finished working, this may result in data corruption.
After confirmation original copy of a file will be overwritten. Please note that all "\n" will be converted to newlines, pass "--preserve-newlines" to avoid that.

This will only translate English variables.
