# DR_localizationLocalizer
A quick and dirty way to translate global variables for Steam version of Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc.

To use it, obtain dr_localization.bin (it could also work directly with dr_data.wad with ungodly memory consumption, if there is enough interest, I will rewrite it)

Either run it without parameters in same folder as dr_localization.bin, or pass required file as first parameter.
When prompted, use some text editor that respects encoding (i.e. Notepad++) to edit the text file (do not replace newlines manually).
After confirmation original copy of a file will be overwritten. Please note that all "\n" will be converted to newlines, pass "--preserve-newlines" to avoid that.

This will only translate English variables.
